# odin-etch-a-sketch

Project: Etch-A-Sketch for theodinproject

The goal of this project is a browser version of something between a notepad and an Etch-A-Sketch. The project uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript. JavaScript was used to manipulate the DOM. Most of the layout was created using grid layout method.

To color a "pixel" simply hover over it. Holding down the Shift key allows you to move without affecting anything and holding down the ctrl key or pressing left mouse button removes applied black color. Pressing restart button allows you to clear the drawing area and specify how big you want it to be. Note that 100 is the max size and 1 is the minimum. With high numbers, such as 100, the tracking of the mouse position is not fast enough. Technically this is true for any size but it's more noticeable when going big.
